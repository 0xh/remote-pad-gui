Electron app to manage both
[Remote Pad](https://github.com/comsolid/remote-pad/)
and [Remote Pad Server](https://github.com/comsolid/remote-pad-server).

## App in action

The app wraps two services, Remote Pad Web and Remote Pad Server,
and starts them for you.

After connected you can configure an emulator, for example
[Mupen64Plus](https://github.com/mupen64plus/mupen64plus-core/)
and start the game within the app with preconfigured inputs.
